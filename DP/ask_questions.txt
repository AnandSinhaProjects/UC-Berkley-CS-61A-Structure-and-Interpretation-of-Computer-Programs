Framework for Solving DP Problems:

1. Define the objective function
-- Lets define the scope of the problem and work with that ->

2. Idenitfy base cases
The base cases are ->

3. Write down a recurrence relation for the optimized objective function

4. What's the order of execution?

5. Where to look for the answer?
